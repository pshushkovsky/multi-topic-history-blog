<h1> Information and Privacy in History </h1>

In a world of growing digitalization and data gathering individual privacy has come to a threat. Every email, facebook message or Instagram direct sent is saved. It is easier now than ever to locate individuals. There is a rise of self-surveillance through the use of mobile phones, car cams, drones and other easily available digital devises, which threaten digital exposure  [Kingsley, 2008]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2008.00793.x). This project, therefore, wants to remind the world of the regimes in history were individual privacy was undermined and the negative impacts it held on personal freedom and well-being. It intends to gather oral accounts of ordinary citizens living in centrally oppressive regimes, such as the former Soviet Union and its satellite states and the People's Republic of China, as well as others. It will attempt to answer questions regarding:
1.	Informational sources available to these individuals, 
2.	Privacy breaches,
3.	Their coping mechanisms living under such circumstances.

By presenting it in a digital form this project hopes to emphasis the parallels between the possible future breaches of privacy and informational sources with some of the harshest regimes in history.
