However, in the Cold War era, no such deal was as simple as that. Sending military assistance is one thing, but placing offensive nuclear weapons is another. Khrushchev held higher intentions than to just protect his new ally Cuba. The Soviet Unions and the United States relations soured in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as they were unable to reach an agreement about Berlin, and the Gary Powers U2 spy plane incident exposed the United States spying on the Soviet Union. Khrushchev was left with pursuing a hardline approach against the West, as he was beginning to be accused of being weak against the ‘imperialists’ [Taubman, 534](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). Therefore, he hoped to intimidate Kennedy, who he saw as ‘a spoiled rich young man,’ with his brinkmanship tactics [Zubok, 139](https://www.uncpress.org/book/9780807859582/a-failed-empire/). What better way to do so than in the United States’ backyard?


Also, placing _offensive_ missiles to help _defend_ Cuba did not make sense. According to the CIA, between the 1st and 5th, September construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) sites in Guanajay began. Further development of IRBM sites occurred in central Cuba at Remedios site between 15th and 20th September. There were also two sites constructing (medium-range ballistic missile) MRBM at San Cristobal and at Sagua la Grande between 15th and 30th September [McAuliffe, 7-8](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GexAR4F1wtQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=where+were+the+soviet+missiles+located+in+cuba&ots=1zRgFcMIUy&sig=hPYzBGMnMe3OKgDhazeYAgHWzww#v=onepage&q=where%20were%20the%20soviet%20missiles%20located%20in%20cuba&f=false). The MRBM’s could reach Washington D.C. from Cuba and the IRBM’s could reach all the way to San Francisco. Was Khrushchev thinking to attack the United States? 


As a matter of fact, no. This was Khrushchev’s clear play at brinkmanship. He did not want to use nuclear weapons. He later stated, ‘The main thing was that the installation of our missiles in Cuba would, I thought, restrain the United States from precipitous military action against Castro's government.’ He hoped to frighten the United States [Taubman, 535](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930).[^1] Khrushchev hoped to bluff the Soviet Union’s nuclear superiority to the world but instead, it brought him to face the possibility of a nuclear war.


On October 16th Kennedy and his advisors met to discuss the photographs taken by the U2 spy plane on October 14th of the Soviet missiles on Cuba. They knew the missiles had to go. Kennedy decided the best tactic was a naval blockade [Taubman, 557](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). He rightfully said ‘the United States is determined that this threat to the security of the hemisphere be removed,’ he could not accept such a close threat from the Soviet Union [Taubman, 560](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). The Soviet Union was treading on United States security region. On October 22nd, Kennedy announced the presence of Soviet missiles Cuba on television and declared a quarantine. American warships were positions 800 kilometers from the eastern tip of Cuba [Bell and Gilbert, 186](https://www.amazon.ca/World-Since-1945-International-History/dp/1472524756).


On 24th October six Soviet ships chose to turn around and avoid any confrontation [Bell and Gilbert, 186](https://www.amazon.ca/World-Since-1945-International-History/dp/1472524756). In the eyes of the public, Kennedy won. He managed to call Khrushchev’s bluff and policy of brinkmanship. In the following days, Kennedy and Khrushchev exchange letters in which they agreed for the Soviet removal of missiles from Cuba and the United States assured it will not invade Cuba. Privately, Robert Kennedy also agreed to remove American missiles from Turkey [Bell and Gilbert, 187-8](https://www.amazon.ca/World-Since-1945-International-History/dp/1472524756). In the end, the United States was able to protect its regional security from a Soviet threat and withstand Khrushchev’s deadly brinkmanship policy.
