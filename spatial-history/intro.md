<h1>Soviet Union in Uncle Sam’s Backyard</h1>

<section id="test">

In October 1962, the whole world turned its eyes to Cuba. The region came to high alert as the two Cold War superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, held each other in a standoff blockade. First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev hoped to show his support for the new Communist government in Cuba and frighten young President John F. Kennedy from taking any further military actions against Cuba by placing Soviet missiles there. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a test of brinkmanship, the Soviet Union tested the United States’ leadership and security by interfering in Uncle Sam’s backyard.

The United States held strong tries to Cuba prior to the Cuban revolution in 1959. Some historians, such as Morris H. Morley, argued the United States held imperial state policies towards Cuba [Morley, 1](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tTJRsOhcXLMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=why+was+cuba+important+to+the+united+states&ots=yp7kU-Z3H5&sig=QooIuI4Ijkjzu5vyDqrK_FPC5Gw#v=onepage&q=why%20was%20cuba%20important%20to%20the%20united%20states&f=false). During Fulgencio Batista’s military dictatorship rule, between 1952 and 1959, the United States controlled a large influence over its economy. Most of Cuba’s exports were to the United States [Bell and Gilbert, 178](https://www.amazon.ca/World-Since-1945-International-History/dp/1472524756). In 1959, Fidel Castro led a resistance movement against Batista’s dictatorship and took hold of Havana. He was strongly anti-American and began to nationalize all American owned properties and businesses. The United States called an embargo. On April 17th, 1961, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) hoped to take Castro down by force. They sent 1400 Cuban exiles to land in Cuba at the Bay of Pigs and lead a revolution. However, the mission failed, and the exiles were either fatally injured or taken as prisoners [Bell and Gilbert, 179](https://www.amazon.ca/World-Since-1945-International-History/dp/1472524756).  


Prior to 1959, the Soviet Union held no interest in Cuba. However, Khrushchev began to take an interest in new states coming from revolutions to gain allies for the Soviet Union. When Castro’s force swept the military dictatorship of Batista, Khrushchev had ‘no clear idea of who they were and what they stood for' [Taubman, 532](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). Nevertheless, after his trip to the United States, Khrushchev ordered the Warsaw pact to send weapons to Havana to support Castro [Taubman, 532](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). Khrushchev’s and Castro’s relations grew closer between 1960 and 1961. Alarmed by the Bay of Pigs incident the Soviets expanded military aid in February 1962 [Taubman, 534](https://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?4781930). In late May the Soviet delegation offered a secret deal with Castro to set up nuclear ballistic missile bases in Cuba.
